## ðŸš€ Setup
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

```

GitHub Pages deployment is automated to the `gh-pages` branch.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. Run the development server with `npm run dev`.
2. Open the local URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
3. Click anywhere on the canvas to place towers.
4. Defend your path from the waves of emoji enemies!
5. Defeating enemies grants gold. Harder enemies give more gold.

After building (`./setup.sh`), you can also open `docs/index.html` directly in your browser.
